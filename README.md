```

For installing, you may follow the link below:

[Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

[Installing the AWS SSM Plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)

### Installation

You can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/semiherdogan/aws-ssh/releases).
Move the binary to your PATH and make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x aws-ssh
mv aws-ssh /usr/local/bin/aws-ssh
```

> On first run on MacOS, you need to allow the app to run in your security settings. Go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and click on `Allow Anyway` for the app.

### Usage

```bash
aws-ssh [--profile|-p] [--region|-r] searchparam1 searchparam2 ...
```

This will launch a UI that lists all your EC2 instances. You can search and select the instance you wish to connect to. The tool will then initiate a connection using the AWS Session Manager.

### Features

- Easy to use TUI for selecting EC2 instances
- Search functionality to quickly find your instances
- Connects to EC2 through AWS Session Manager for secure access

### Region Configuration

Add regions key into sections in your `.aws/credentials` file to specify the regions you want to auto connect to (comma separated).
If this key given in the configuration file, this tool automatically searches for instances in the specified regions.
If you don't specify any regions, the tool will ask you to select a region when you run it.
Example:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
regions = us-east-1,us-west-2
```

## Required AWS Permissions

To run this application, you need the following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions:

### Minimum Required Permissions
1. **Describe Instances**:
   - `ec2:DescribeInstances`

2. **SSM Session Start** (for SSH commands via SSM):
   - `ssm:StartSession`

### Example IAM Policy
Hereâ€™s an example of an IAM policy that grants the necessary permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ssm:StartSession"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Notes
- If you want to restrict access further, you can limit the `Resource` field to specific EC2 instances or tags.
- Ensure the IAM user or role also has permissions to use the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) agent if required for SSH sessions.
- **SSM must be enabled for the EC2 instance** to use this tool. Ensure that the instance has the necessary IAM role attached and the SSM agent is installed and running. You can follow the steps to enable SSM for your instance in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-prerequisites.html).
